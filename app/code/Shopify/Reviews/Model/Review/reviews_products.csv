2024-pillars-of-creation-and-cosmic-priority-mail-postage-stamps,2024  Pillars of Creation and Cosmic  Priority Mail Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>?¡ãThis new Priority Mail stamp features a digitally colored depiction of the invisible bands of mid-infrared light emitted by the Pillars of Creation,?¡À according to the Postal Service.</p>
<p>?¡ãBy assigning color to various wavelengths, the digitized image allows us to see a landscape otherwise invisible to the human eye,?¡À the USPS said. ?¡ãRed areas toward the end of the pillars show burgeoning stars ejecting raw materials as they form, while the relatively small red orbs scattered throughout the image show newly born stars.?¡À</p>
<p>The Pillars of Creation span approximately four to five light-years and are a small part of the Eagle Nebula, which is 70 by 55 light-years, according to NASA. Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe Loys de Cheseaux discovered the Eagle Nebula in 1745. (According to NASA, a ?¡ãlight year is the distance a photon of light travels in one year, which is about 6 trillion miles.?¡À)</p>
<p>?¡ãWebb?¡¥s new view of the Pillars of Creation, which were first made famous when imaged by NASA?¡¥s Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, will help researchers revamp their models of star formation by identifying far more precise counts of newly formed stars, along with the quantities of gas and dust in the region,?¡À NASA said in an article published Oct. 19, 2022, on its website.</p>
<p>Some of the pillars have wavy lava-like lines near their edges. According to NASA, those lines ?¡ãare ejections from stars that are still forming within the gas and dust.?¡À</p>

2024-pillars-of-creation-priority-mail-postage-stamps,2024 Pillars of Creation Priority Mail Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Captured in awe-inspiring detail by NASA?¡¥s James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) in 2022, the Pillars of Creation provide clues to the origins of our solar system. The U.S. Postal Service celebrates our continued exploration of deep space with a captivating Priority Mail? stamp.</p>
<p>Having recreated images first captured by NASA?¡¥s Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 and 2014 using Webb in mid-infrared light, astronomers are using this new image to build a deeper understanding of this star-forming region.</p>
<p>The image on the stamp is a digitally colored depiction of the invisible bands of mid-infrared light emitted by the Pillars of Creation. By assigning color to various infrared wavelengths, the digitized image allows us to see a landscape otherwise invisible to the human eye.</p>
<p>Red areas toward the end of the pillars show burgeoning stars ejecting raw materials as they form, while the relatively small red orbs scattered throughout the image show newly born stars. Some of that same material may coalesce into new planets.</p>
<p>Launched on December 25, 2021, NASA?¡¥s James Webb Space Telescope is the largest and most sensitive telescope ever deployed in space. Revealing the cosmos in vivid infrared detail, it is designed to provide scientists with breathtaking images and new data. It is already providing new insights into our cosmic origins and revealing new areas of the universe to explore.</p>
<p>Art director Greg Breeding designed the stamp, using an image provided by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), ESA (European Space Agency), Canadian Space Agency, and Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>

2024-saul-bellow-three-ounce-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Saul Bellow Three Ounce Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Author Saul Bellow was honored today with a new stamp, the 34th in the Postal Service?¡¥s Literary Arts series.</p>
<p>Bellow considered himself a historian of American identity, populating his books with dreamers and intellectuals searching for meaning in a materialistic, sometimes disorienting world. The subtle analysis of modern culture and immigrant experience woven through Bellow?¡¥s writings combined fierce social criticism with a comic gusto that drew in readers.</p>
<p>Widely regarded as one of the greatest authors of the 20th century, Bellow was the recipient of a record three National Book Awards, a Nobel Prize and a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>The stamp features a portrait of the author with a Chicago street scene in the background. He wears a fedora, white turtleneck and dark jacket. Behind him are skyscrapers, with the ?¡ãL?¡À train running between the buildings. The title ?¡ãSaul Bellow?¡À is in dark purple letters in the upper-right corner, with ?¡ãThree Ounce?¡À and ?¡ãUSA?¡À appearing vertically along the left side.</p>
<p>Ethel Kessler, an art director for USPS, designed the stamp, with original art by illustrator Joe Ciardiello based on photographs from 1982. To keep the writer?¡¥s image as the focal point, the artist painted much of the background in neutral colors using a pale-yellow wash and some brownish-grays and a bit of purple.</p>
<p>The words ?¡ãTHREE OUNCE?¡À on this stamp indicate its usage value, meaning that it may be used on a mail piece weighing three ounces. Like a Forever? stamp, it will always be valid for the rate printed on it.</p>

2024-lunar-new-year-year-of-the-dragon-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Lunar New Year ? Year of the Dragon Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The stamp features a colorful, three-dimensional mask depicting a dragon. Created out of paper, then cut, scored, and folded into shape, the mask is a contemporary take on the long tradition of paper-cut folk-art crafts created during this time of year. The dragon is embellished with acrylic paint and other paper elements, like flowers and tassels. Gold and red are the predominant colors ?a gold signifying prosperity in the coming year, and red representing good fortune.</p>
<p>People born in the Year of the Dragon, the most auspicious sign in the Chinese zodiac, are said to be successful, wise, and powerful. Many Asian communities experience a baby boom because of the allure of the dragon, as many consider the sign to be favorable. In 2024, the Lunar New Year will mark the beginning of the Year of the Wood Dragon. Wood Dragons are said to be quieter and more introverted, but also successful, strong leaders who dedicate themselves fully to their work.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2020, in observance of the Lunar New Year holiday, the U.S. Postal Service introduced its third<span>?</span><em>Lunar New Year</em><span>?</span>series. This is the fifth Forever? stamp in that series, which will continue through 2031 with stamps for the Year of the Snake, Horse, Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. Art director Antonio Alcal¡§¡é designed the stamp with original art by Camille Chew.</p>

2023-ruth-bader-ginsburg,2023 Ruth Bader Ginsburg Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The United States Postal Service today released a new Forever stamp honoring the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The stamp?¡¥s unveiling took place at the Smithsonian?¡¥s National Portrait Gallery during a first-day-of-issue dedication ceremony that was open to the public.</p>
<p>Designed by Ethel Kessler, an art director for USPS, with a Michael J. Deas oil painting based on a photograph by Philip Bermingham, the stamp captures the 107th U.S. Supreme Court justice in her black judicial robe and favorite white-lace collar.</p>
<p>?¡ãJustice Ginsburg was an iconic figure who dedicated her life to public service and the pursuit of justice,?¡À said USPS Board of Governors Chairman Roman Martinez IV. ?¡ãShe was a true pioneer, and it is our honor to celebrate her incredible legacy in this way. This stamp serves not just as a tribute but as an inspiration for future generations to uphold the values she fought for.?¡À</p>
<p>Joining Martinez for the ceremony were Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent at National Public Radio; Lori Dym, USPS procurement and property law managing counsel; Elizabeth Glazer, founder of the public safety nonprofit Vital City; and Ginsburg?¡¥s granddaughter Clara Spera, a lecturer at Harvard Law School and senior associate at WilmerHale.</p>

2024-constance-baker-motley-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Constance Baker Motley  Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Constance Baker Motley started her career in 1945 when she began working for the future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</p>
<p>From 1945 to 1965, Motley worked on about 60 cases that reached the Supreme Court. She won nine of the 10 cases she argued before the Court.</p>
<p>In 1966, Motley was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ?a the largest and busiest federal trial court in the country. She rose to chief judge in 1982 and senior judge in 1986.</p>
<p>The stamp features a portrait of Motley by artist Charly Palmer, based on an Associated Press photograph. Rendered in acrylic on canvas work, the portrait displays elements of Palmer?¡¥s signature style. The stenciled circular shapes around the head suggest royalty, and the heavy brushstrokes and scratches provide added textures. Stenciled curlicues embellish the lower background and continue onto Motley?¡¥s black dress. Her colorful corsage and a brooch further enliven the image.</p>

2024-underground-railroad-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Underground Railroad Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>From the time slavery was introduced to the Colonies until it was abolished in 1865, enslaved people tried to escape it. Ten stamps from the U.S. Postal Service commemorate the Underground Railroad, as their resistance efforts became known.</p>
<p>Most remained anonymous, but some left their mark on history. The pane of 20 stamps depicts 10 men and women who escaped slavery and/or helped others escape.</p>
<p>In the first row of stamps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ca 1868¡§C1869 photograph of Harriet Tubman by Benjamin Powelson of Auburn, New York. Tubman (ca 1822¡§C1913) escaped slavery, then returned to Maryland numerous times to lead others to freedom. During the Civil War she also worked for the Union side as a scout and spy;</li>
<li>A ca 1850 photograph of Thomas Garrett (1789¡§C1871), a Delaware-based Quaker operative;</li>
<li>A photograph of William Still taken between 1865 and 1880. Still (1821¡§C1902), who was born to a mother who had escaped slavery and a father who had purchased his own freedom, became the leader of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee;</li>
<li>An 1894 photograph of Harriet Jacobs (1813¡§C1897), who escaped slavery and later wrote a memoir describing the horrors of her life in bondage and her escape;</li>
<li>An undated photograph of Rev. Jermain Loguen (1813¡§C1872), who escaped slavery and became an operative based in Syracuse, New York.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second row are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An undated engraving of Catharine Coffin (ca 1803¡§C1881), a Quaker operative based in Indiana and Ohio;</li>
<li>An 1873 photograph of Lewis Hayden (ca 1811¡§C1889), who escaped slavery and became an operative based in Boston;</li>
<li>A photograph of Frederick Douglass (1818¡§C1895), believed to have been taken about 1848 by the notable Boston photographic firm of Southworth &amp; Hawes. Douglass escaped slavery, then rose to fame as an abolitionist and orator. He sheltered freedom seekers in his Rochester, New York, home;</li>
<li>An undated photograph of William Lambert (1817¡§C1890), who was born free and became an operative based in Detroit;</li>
<li>A ca 1864 photograph of Laura Haviland (1808¡§C1898), a Michigan-based Quaker operative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below each portrait are eight lines of text, identical on each stamp: BLACK/WHITE; COOPERATION; TRUST/DANGER; FLIGHT/FAITH; COURAGE/RISK; DEFIANCE/HOPE; UNDERGROUND; RAILROAD/USA.</p>
<p>The Underground Railroad was a ?¡ãrailroad?¡À in name only, and it started as a loosely organized secret network long before the invention of transportation via steel rail. It was powered not by coal but by human courage and imagination ?a that of freedom seekers themselves and of the ?¡ãoperatives?¡À who assisted them. As railroads grew in the 1830s and 1840s, the secret network adopted their terminology. ?¡ãStationmasters?¡À and ?¡ãconductors?¡À now assisted ?¡ãpassengers?¡À traveling from one ?¡ãstation?¡À to another on the ?¡ãUnderground Railroad.?¡À</p>
<p>In the northern states, free Blacks, religious groups, and Native Americans played significant roles. The Underground Railroad operated in the South, too. Over time, what had been a loose underground network coalesced into a more smoothly functioning system as it responded to the increasing numbers of freedom seekers and a corresponding rise in attempts to thwart escapes.</p>
<p>The Civil War broke out in 1861. From the start, thousands of enslaved men, women, and children fled into Union Army encampments, where they were declared free. In 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, liberating all enslaved people in the Rebel states. In 1865, following the end of the Civil War, the 13th Amendment was ratified, abolishing slavery throughout the country. No longer needed, the Underground Railroad shut down.</p>

2024-betty-ford-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024  Betty Ford  Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The stamp design was unveiled at the White House by First Lady Jill Biden, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Susan Ford Bales, daughter of former President Gerald R. Ford and former First Lady Betty Ford.</p>
<p>The dedication ceremony for the Forever stamp will be held April 5 ?a three days before the 106th anniversary of her birth. The event will take place at the Annenberg Health Sciences Building located at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, CA.</p>
<p>?¡ãBetty Ford changed the role of first lady,?¡À said Postmaster General DeJoy. ?¡ãShe used the role not just as a platform to represent the nation and advance and support her husband, she used it to speak openly and honestly about issues she cared about, and about personal issues she faced.?¡À</p>
<p>Elizabeth Anne Bloomer Ford (1918¡§C2011), wife of the 38th president, was first lady of the United States from 1974 to 1977. After the Watergate scandal forced the resignation of President Richard Nixon on Aug. 9, 1974, and an earlier scandal pushed out Vice President Spiro Agnew, Gerald Ford became the first U.S. president who had never been elected president or vice president. In her new role as first lady, Betty Ford, impressed the American public in interviews by showing humor and frankness about controversial issues facing the country.</p>
<p>?¡ãMom would be humbled and grateful beyond words for the extraordinary tribute of her commemorative stamp,?¡À said daughter Susan Ford Bales, who attended the White House event. ?¡ãTo?Mom, the stamp would be a?heartwarming?reminder of joys of millions of breast cancer and substance use disorder survivors who have overcome their diseases?and?individually added to her?legacy of candor and courage.?¡À</p>
<p>While the Fords never intended to inhabit the White House, Betty Ford embraced the role, becoming the most politically outspoken first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt and helping mold the position?¡¥s modern role.</p>
<p>Throughout her husband?¡¥s political career, Mrs. Ford openly fought for women?¡¥s rights, often conflicting with the Republican Party?¡¥s stances. She campaigned tirelessly for the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have mandated constitutional equality for all Americans, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>After being diagnosed with breast cancer, Mrs. Ford underwent a mastectomy on Sept. 28, 1974. While medical issues of previous first ladies weren?¡¥t always disclosed, Mrs. Ford chose to share the story of her treatment for the once-taboo medical condition.</p>
<p>In 1964, Mrs. Ford had begun taking prescription pain pills for a pinched nerve in her neck, developing a substance use disorder over time. In 1978, after an intervention, she entered the Naval Regional Medical Hospital in Long Beach, CA, for treatment. As with her breast cancer, she publicly acknowledged her substance use disorder, changing its perception and putting a face to the disease.</p>
<p>In 1982, Mrs. Ford and former ambassador and close family friend Leonard Firestone established the Betty Ford Center for substance dependency. She agreed to lend her name to the center, hoping to destigmatize substance use disorder treatment at a time when it wasn?¡¥t spoken about openly ?a especially by women ?a and options for treatment were scarce. Her work helped change the way treatment options and those seeking it are viewed by American society.</p>

2024-save-manatees-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Save Manatees Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The?<em>Save Manatees</em>?stamp is being issued to create awareness about the threats posed to this beloved marine mammal. Human vigilance is crucial for the protection of the threatened West Indian manatee?aboth to minimize motorboat strikes and to maintain the aquatic plants on which it feeds.</p>
<p>The gentle West Indian manatee?inhabits warm inland waterways in Florida and warm areas of the coastal Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. The Florida manatee, present year-round in the state?¡¥s rivers and springs, is one of two subspecies of West Indian manatee<em>.</em></p>
<p>The stamp?¡¥s stylized artwork, predominantly aqua-colored, shows a manatee underwater, placidly lolling near the surface.</p>
<p>These slow-swimming marine mammals hungrily feed on shallow-water aquatic plants, eating up to 10 percent of their body weight each day. An adult West Indian manatee typically weighs about 1,000 to 1,500 pounds and is about eight to 11 feet long. Its prehensile lips and its sensitive, flexible whiskers help the manatee guide its leafy meals to its mouth. The manatee?¡¥s busy feeding schedule is interrupted by frequent underwater naps, during which the animal surfaces to breathe every 10 minutes or so?amore often when actively swimming. Florida manatees thrive in water of 68??F or warmer. Their summer range reaches the coastal Carolinas?afarther north on occasion.</p>
<p>Manatees have no natural predators but are slow to reproduce. A female manatee gives birth to one offspring at a time, nursing for several months before the calf starts eating plants. A mother may tend to her young for up to about two years, communicating with touches, nuzzling ?¡ãkisses?¡À and sounds including chirps, squeaks, and squeals.</p>
<p>West Indian Manatee populations have rebounded from lows of only several hundred individuals in the 1970s. In 2017, its status under the Endangered Species Act was upgraded from?endangered to threatened. Although thousands of West Indian Manatees exist today, surging numbers of die-offs have recently raised alarm.</p>
<p>Toxic algae blooms, worsened by pollution, kill seagrass. In recent years, this loss of manatees?¡¥ primary food resources has led to starvation. Collisions with fast-moving watercraft can also prove fatal; almost all grown manatees bear scars from boat propellers.</p>
<p>This docile creature benefits from watercraft speed limits, refuge areas, and heightened awareness of manatee vulnerability. To help protect Florida?¡¥s official marine mammal, many residents purchase ?¡ãSave the Manatee?¡À license plates, raising funds for conservation and increasing awareness.</p>

2024-bluegrass-stamp-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Bluegrass Stamp Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Born in the mid-20th century, bluegrass defies time, drawing inspiration from the past while also openly embracing innovation. At once rural and urban, emotional and highly technical, this singular American music style remains unconstrained by geography, attracting fans worldwide who all share the same passion for what they affectionately call the ?¡ãhigh lonesome sound.?¡À</p>
<p>Inspired by vintage bluegrass concert posters, the stamp art features four acoustic string instruments typical of bluegrass bands: guitar, five-string banjo, fiddle, and mandolin. Text at the top of the stamp reads ?¡ãHigh Lonesome Sound,?¡À the title of a 1963 documentary about Appalachian folk music and a familiar nickname for bluegrass.</p>
<p>The five-string banjo dominates the sound of bluegrass and, along with guitar, mandolin, and bass, sets the rhythmic foundation of this often fast-paced music. Fiddle, mandolin, banjo, and guitar evoke a range of melodic flavors and emotions in their solos and backup. Instrumental dexterity, combined with tight vocal harmonies and heartfelt, sometimes mournful lyrics, creates an electrifying and emotional experience for both performers and listeners.</p>
<p>Music historians generally agree that bluegrass as we know it originated with Bill Monroe (1911¡§C1996), who drew on old-time fiddle and church music as well as gospel, blues, and jazz to fashion a style of music that was both brand-new and achingly familiar. By 1945, Monroe and his band, the Blue Grass Boys, had solidified the key components of bluegrass: refined vocal harmonies, driving tempos, and outstanding musicianship.</p>
<p>Once viewed as a type of country music, bluegrass?awhich musicologist Alan Lomax famously described as ?¡ãfolk music with overdrive?¡À?aemerged as its own distinct genre in the 1950s. Soon the music could be found just about everywhere, from college campuses and large urban areas to television shows and movies. Outdoor festivals became a mainstay of bluegrass in the 1970s, a period when the music took off in new directions as bands eagerly incorporated influences from rock and pop.</p>
<p>Today, although bluegrass enjoys relatively little radio exposure, the music continues to thrive. The nonprofit International Bluegrass Music Association was founded in 1985, a bluegrass category was added to the Grammy Awards in 1989, and the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame was founded in Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1991.?<em>Billboard?</em>launched its bluegrass albums chart in 2002, two years after the wildly popular soundtrack to the film?<em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em>?introduced bluegrass to yet another generation of fans. Today, bluegrass festivals held around the world, like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado and Bluegrass Live! in North Carolina, draw thousands of fans every year.</p>

2024-garden-delights-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 Garden Delights  Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service has issued Garden Delights, four stamps celebrating the flora of America?¡¥s spring and summer gardens and the vital role of hummingbirds in their pollination. Each stamp showcases a female ruby-throated hummingbird hovering next to either a zinnia, cigar flower, spotted touch-me-not or sunflower. A dedication for the stamps was held today in Strongsville.</p>
<p>The bloom of spring flowers is a source of delight for gardeners and non-gardeners alike, particularly after the chill of a long winter. While gardens provide joy, sustenance, and a sense of purpose to those who tend them, they also give birds, plants and animals a refuge and the resources they need to survive.</p>
<p>No garden would be complete without the buzzes, hums and musical melodies of nature?¡¥s visiting wildlife. Hummingbirds, in particular, bring joy to summer gardens with their unusual features and petite size.</p>
<p>Hummingbirds are found only in the Americas, with about 16 different species native to the United States. Ruby-throated hummingbirds (<em>Archilochus colubris</em>) are among the smallest ?a about the weight of a penny and 3.5 inches long. They are the only hummingbirds found in the gardens of the eastern and central parts of the United States.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The digital illustration on this stamp features a highly stylized white bird made out of four geometric shapes shown against a rich red background. Facing the upper right corner of the stamp, the bird carries in its beak a pink envelope sealed with a red heart.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The envelope carried by the bird on this stamp serves a purpose similar to the stamp itself, hinting at a fond greeting from a loved one even before the letter or card has been opened.

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">As the 19th century produce industry became a big interstate business, competition among growers increased.??Each sought new and unique advertising gimmicks to beat out their rivals.??They hired skilled lithographers to design and print vibrant crate labels.??Images of bright yellow lemons and vivid red tomatoes popped off the labels, enticing customers and effectively marketing the various brands.?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Before the turn of the century, stone lithography was still widely used.??Artists hand-etched their graphic designs into limestone, applied ink, and then pressed the images onto heavy paper labels.?</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Many old crate labels still exist in collections and antique shops.??The remaining examples provide a timeline of agricultural marketing over three-quarters of a century.??Today referred to as ?¡ãagro-lithography,?¡À these images offer a colorful glimpse into the history and changes in American advertising during that time.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">On May 18, 1968, Hot Wheels released its first toy cars, dubbed ?¡ãThe Sweet 16.?¡À? Since then, they?¡¥ve become one of the world?¡¥s most popular toy car makers, with the company estimating that they sell eight Hot Wheels every second.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In 1968, Hot Wheels revolutionized the toy car industry.? Up until that point, Matchbox had ruled the market with its realistic street cars.? But the creators of Hot Wheels had a pioneering vision that would change the way toy cars would be made.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Elliot Handler, co-founder of Mattel, had conceived of Hot Wheels in the 1960s to appeal to boys as Barbie had become a hit with girls.? His idea was to create toy cars with the unique style of those that were produced in custom car shops.? To realize his vision, he hired Chevrolet designer Harry Bentley Bradley to lead a team of creators in developing a set of 16 sleek muscle cars.? These cars were painted with bright, metallic colors and engineered to move quickly along the company?¡¥s signature orange track.? When Handler saw the first batch of cars, he exclaimed, ?¡ãThose are some hot wheels,?¡À and the name was born. ?Those first 16 cars, called ?¡ãThe Sweet 16,?¡À were released on May 18, 1968.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Hot Wheels were an immediate hit with young boys, with 16 million cars sold in the first year alone.? Their unexpected success rocked the toy car market, with other companies searching for a way to emulate them.? At Hot Wheels, new designers joined the team, helping to create fresh, new cars that matched the ever-rising expectations of their customers.? Among these new designers was Larry Woods, who would earn the nickname ?¡ãMr. Hot Wheels.?¡À? Woods was the lead designer at Hot Wheels for nearly 40 years, producing some of the company?¡¥s most popular and memorable cars.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Over the course of Hot Wheels?¡¥ more than 50-year history, the company has produced about three billion cars ¡§C over 800 different models, and 11,000 variations.? According to Mattel, eight Hot Wheels are sold every second.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In 2018, the USPS issued the set of 10 Hot Wheels stamps to mark the company?¡¥s 50th?anniversary.? They were issued in Fort Worth, Texas at the Goodguys 26th Summit Racing Lone Star Nationals at Texas Motor Speedway.? At the stamps?¡¥ dedication, a USPS official said, ?¡ãToday, we make history as the Postal Service and our partners at Mattel are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Hot Wheels with these dynamic stamps showcasing the iconic toys that were a part of my childhood and that of my children.? These miniature works of art truly capture the thrill and excitement of these legendary vehicles and now will speed their way as Forever stamps on millions of cards and letters.?¡À</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,180-520-100,0.0,shopify,999,continue,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/04a345ca015e1795fb35854865c989b.webp?v=1728359970,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/04a345ca015e1795fb35854865c989b.webp?v=1728359970,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

2020-hanukkah-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2020 Hanukkah Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Descrption:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">WASHINGTON, DC<strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</strong>?a Celebrate the joyous Jewish holiday of Hanukkah with a new stamp from the U.S. Postal Service. Also called the Festival of Lights, Hanukkah is a family-centered celebration that includes the ceremonial lighting of the hanukiah<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">,?</em>the nine-branched menorah used during the holiday.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãThis new Hanukkah stamp illustrates the lighting of the hanukiahon the last evening of the holiday,?¡À said USPS Controller and Vice President Cara Greene. ?¡ãAll eight of the Hanukkah candles have been lit, and the child is reaching up to replace the shamash<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">,?</em>the helper candle used to light the others in the menorah.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The stamps are available nationwide today. A virtual dedication ceremony will be posted on the Postal Service?¡¥s Facebook and Twitter pages. The event includes remarks from Greene, Rabbi Lennard Thal and stamp artist Jing Jing Tsong.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Tsong chose her colors intentionally to evoke Hanukkah traditions as seen through the eyes of children. The darker blue colors in the background symbolize winter, while the brightly colored flaming candles reflect the spirit and warmth of sharing the holiday traditions.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The story of Hanukkah ?a ?¡ãdedication?¡À in Hebrew ?a tells of reclaiming the Temple in Jerusalem, which had been desecrated by a conquering army. Worshippers prepared to rededicate the holy space but discovered that only one small jar of consecrated oil remained, enough to last one day. Rather than wait for more oil to arrive, they lit the Temple menorah, which burned for eight days.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This miracle of the oil is celebrated during Hanukkah with the ceremonial lighting of the hanukiah. Celebrants recite blessings each night, one before and one during the lighting. A third blessing, known as the Shehecheyanu<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">,</em>?is recited or sung only on the first night of the festival just as it is on other special family occasions. The candle for the first night is put on the far-right side of the?hanukiah. On each subsequent night, an additional candle is placed to the immediate left of the previous night?¡¥s candle ?a right to left, the direction in which Hebrew is read. The candles are then lit from left to right, beginning with the newest candle.?Some families take this opportunity to explain more about their heritage and the symbolism behind the ritual.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">After the lighting of the candles, celebrants might play games, host a sing-along of favorite Hanukkah tunes, or prepare and eat fried foods traditionally consumed during the holiday.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In 2020, Hanukkah begins on the evening of Dec. 10.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Contemporary Boutonniere</em>?is a new Forever? stamp issued by the Post Service. Similar in design to the two-ounce Garden Corsage stamp, it can be used on RSVP envelopes often enclosed with wedding invitations. It is also perfect for party invitations, thank-you notes, and announcements, in addition to regular correspondence.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The?Contemporary Boutonniere?stamp art features a photograph of a burgundy mini-cymbidium orchid bloom, a succulent, and a touch of green hydrangea, accented with loops of variegated lily grass. Each of these materials is right on trend for today?¡¥s modern designs. This boutonniere, although suitable for a gentleman, can also be a choice for a lady especially if she prefers something tailored in design. The touch of hydrangea softens the look to make that transition an easy one.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">For centuries, boutonnieres?aor buttonhole flowers, as they were called in Britain?awere a staple of a well-dressed man?¡¥s outfit. For most of the 20th century, a single flower pinned to a lapel or inserted into a jacket buttonhole was part of a sophisticated, debonair man?¡¥s wardrobe. Today, boutonnieres, still very fashionable, are worn at weddings by the groom, groomsmen, father of the groom, and best man, and at other special occasions, including proms, anniversaries, retirement parties, or military memorial services.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The boutonniere was arranged by floral designer Carol Caggiano and photographed by Ren¡§|e Comet.

2021-raven-story-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2021 Raven Story Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The U.S. Postal Service issued the Raven Story stamp at the Sealaska Heritage Institute.?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Art director Antonio Alcal¡§¡é designed the stamp based on art created by Tlingit/Athabascan designer and artist Rico Worl.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãThe Raven Story represents a great meaning to the indigenous people of the Northwest Coast?¡À said Jakki Krage Strako, the Postal Service?¡¥s chief commerce and business solutions officer and executive vice president, who served as the event?¡¥s dedicating official. ?¡ãToday, the Postal Service is proud and honored to create this lasting tribute to the Raven Story through the issuance of this stamp.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Joining Strako to dedicate the stamp were Marlene Johnson, chair of the Sealaska Heritage Institute Board of Trustees; Beth Weldon, mayor of Juneau; Frank Henry Kaash Katasse, playwright, actor and educator; Lance (X??¡¥unei)?A?Twitchell, associate professor of Alaska Native Languages, University of Alaska Southeast, and artist Rico Worl.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãRaven stories are a core aspect to Tlingit epistemology and I?¡¥m excited to share my representation of the Raven Story in a mixed modern and traditional way with this beautiful stamp?¡À said Worl. ?¡ãI hope this stamp inspires people to learn more about Alaska Native and Native American cultures as both rich traditional?people and modern innovative and creative people.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Background</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The stamp design depicts a raven just as he escapes from his human family and begins to transform back into his bird form. To create the stamp art, Worl used formline, the traditional design style of the Indigenous people of the northern Northwest Coast.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The stamp is inspired by the traditional story of the raven setting the sun, moon and stars free. It depicts one of many stories about the raven, a figure of great significance to the Indigenous people of the northern Northwest Coast, part of the area that ranges from Southeast Alaska through coastal British Columbia and south into Washington state.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Among the cultures of the region ?a which include the Tlingit, the Tsimshian, the Haida, the Kwakwaka?¡¥wakw and others ?a the raven plays an essential role in many traditional tales, including stories about the creation of the world. The different peoples of the northern Northwest Coast each have their own culturally specific versions of the raven story, which often convey customs, ethics and cultural inheritances that help communities preserve or affirm their identities.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Raven Story stamp is being issued as a Forever stamp in panes of 20.

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The servicemen interred in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier are ?¡ãKnown But to God,?¡À but they are every American?¡¥s sons and brothers.

2021-sun-science-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2021 Sun Science Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">GREENBELT, MD ?a The U.S. Postal Service issued the Sun Science stamps. The Forever stamps were dedicated during a ceremony at the Greenbelt Main Post Office and are now for sale at Post Offices nationwide. News of the stamps is being shared with the hashtags?<strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">#NASASunScience</strong>?and?<strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">#SunSciencestamps</strong>.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãWe hope these amazing stamps will help generate the same sense of wonder and curiosity about our star that inspired our ancestors and the scientists at NASA to want to better understand the sun, space, and the myriad of possibilities that exist in our solar system, in our universe and beyond,?¡À said Thomas J. Marshall, the Postal Service?¡¥s general counsel and executive vice president, and the stamp ceremony?¡¥s dedicating official.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Background</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Postal Service highlights stunning images of the sun that celebrate the science behind the ongoing exploration of our nearest star.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Printed with a foil treatment that adds a glimmer to the stamps, the images on these stamps come from NASA?¡¥s Solar Dynamics Observatory, a spacecraft launched in February 2010 to keep a constant watch on the sun from geosynchronous orbit above Earth. The striking colors in these images do not represent the actual colors of the sun as perceived by human eyesight. Instead, each image is colorized by NASA according to different wavelengths that reveal or highlight specific features of the sun?¡¥s activity.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">One of the stamps highlights sunspots, two feature images of coronal holes, two show coronal loops, two depict plasma blasts, one is a view of an active sun that emphasizes its magnetic fields, and two show different views of a solar flare.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Heliophysics, the study of the sun and its influence on the planets and space surrounding them, has important implications for our day-to-day lives. Although the space between the sun and Earth appears empty to human eyes, it is actually full of particles and energy from the constant flow of solar wind emitted by the sun. That space is affected by a complex, ever-changing magnetic field that influences our entire solar system. Increased understanding of the sun helps us better explain and predict its impact not only on Earth?¡¥s climate but also on the near-Earth space environment and how it affects sensitive human technology, such as communications systems and satellite electronics. As humanity continues to explore space, a deeper knowledge of solar activity will also make it possible to identify and solve problems involved in communications, data collection, spacecraft and satellite design, and the effects of space radiation on the human body.</p>

2020-thank-you-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2020 Thank You Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description :</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Two simple words can mean so much. Say ?¡ãthank you?¡À in style with four new stamps.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Highlighted in gold foil are the words ""Thank you"" in cursive script and an elegant floral design that swirls through and around the words. Dana Tanamachi, the stamp designer and lettering artist, drew the original sketches for the calligraphy by hand and then created the final art digitally. She added floral elements to the swirls, which resemble vines. Inspired by penmanship from the past, she created an elegant, flowing script that is classic yet fresh and modern, evoking a sense of connection and gratitude. Each of the four stamps features one of these background colors: blue gray, purple, muted green, and soft maroon.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">One of the most thoughtful ways to express gratitude is to send a handwritten note declaring a heartfelt ?¡ãthank you.?¡À Taking the time to commit words of thanks to paper is a ritual that elevates the act of appreciation and gratifies both the recipient and the sender. A few sentences are all that is needed.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Today, there is a renewed awareness of the importance of offering gratitude. Recently published books, websites, and online video tutorials deliver instructions on how to write a note of thanks, and in the process, they have revived an almost lost art.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">These elegant and joyful stamps will add visual appeal to notes, cards, and letters of thanks sent to acknowledge a favor, an act of kindness, or a job well done or to express thanks for gifts sent for any occasion including birthdays, graduations, holidays, and weddings.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",true,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,128-520-100,0.0,shopify,992,continue,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/22-thankyou.webp?v=1728359824,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/22-thankyou.webp?v=1728359824,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Featuring highly stylized digital portraits, the stamp art depicts four types of stony corals with associated reef fish: elkhorn coral, shown with two French angelfish; brain coral, with a spotted moray eel; staghorn coral, with bluestriped grunts; and pillar coral, with a coney grouper and neon gobies.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Coral reefs are formed over thousands of years mainly by colonies of animals called polyps. Polyps make stony corals, the foundation for most coral reefs, by secreting protective skeletons of calcium carbonate or limestone. As these limestone skeletons accumulate over time ?a with new colonies of polyps growing on top of the skeletons of older ones ?a they build up the base of coral reefs.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Coral reefs are some of the world?¡¥s most marvelous ecosystems, sheltering and sustaining about a quarter of all ocean species. Anyone who has snorkeled in tropical environments has witnessed the sea come alive when approaching a coral reef. Suddenly an abundance of fish of all types and colors appear, along with a variety of other animals and plants, including sea urchins, seagrass, octopuses and lobsters.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãFor more than three decades, the Postal Service has issued stamps highlighting the Lunar New Year, and they are some of the most successful stamp releases in our history. This is an important celebration for many Asian people, with an estimated 1.5 billion people around the world marking this special occasion,?¡À said Derek Kan, a member of the USPS Board of Governors, who served as the dedicating official. ?¡ãAs we use this stamp in the weeks ahead, let us reflect on the American journey, and the millions of Asian Americans who have helped walk it.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Other participants at the ceremony were London N. Breed, mayor of San Francisco; Fiona Ma, state treasurer of California, who served as the master of ceremonies; Jay Xu, director of the Asian Art Museum; Claudine Cheng, president of the APA Heritage Foundation; Donald Lu, president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce; and Linda Ng, national president of OCA ?a Asian Pacific American Advocates.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãI want to thank the United States Postal Service and their workers for all the hard work they do every day. This year, we are excited to be the city to introduce the release of the Year of the Rabbit Commemorative Forever Stamp,?¡À said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. ?¡ãAs we look forward to preparing for and celebrating the arrival of spring, this stamp symbolizes our continued commitment to working with one another not only during this time of the year but all year round.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Year of the Rabbit begins Jan. 22 and ends on Feb. 9, 2024.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lunar New Year is an important holiday for many Asian communities around the world. It is primarily celebrated by people of Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tibetan, Mongolian, Malaysian and Filipino heritage. Across these varied cultures, many traditions exist for ringing in a new year of good luck and prosperity. Parades and pageants are common with dancers, acrobats and musicians.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Personality traits and attributes are often associated with people born in the year of a particular animal. Those born in rabbit years are said to be elegant, graceful and kind. Pink, red and purple are lucky colors for rabbits, and plantain lilies are also said to be fortunate. Romantic compatibility, career trajectory and health prospects are also believed to be linked to one?¡¥s birth sign.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on the night of the first full moon after Lunar New Year?¡¥s Eve, known as the Lantern Festival in Chinese culture. In the United States and elsewhere, the festival is marked with grand parades and brilliant lanterns decorating public spaces.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãAt the Asian Art Museum, our mission is to share a broader, richer and more inclusive story of the diverse America we live in today,"" said Jay Xu, the Barbara Bass Bakar director and CEO of the Asian Art Museum. ""Hope characterizes the Year of the Rabbit in 2023 ?a and it fills me with hope to unveil this unique Lunar New Year stamp at our museum, and to showcase the power of art everywhere to help tell that special story with beauty and joy.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In observance of this holiday, the Postal Service introduced its third series of Lunar New Year stamps in 2020. This latest series will continue through 2031 with stamps for the Year of the Dragon, Snake, Horse, Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Boar still to come.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Art director Antonio Alcal¡§¡é worked on the stamp design with artist Camille Chew to create imagery that is fresh, fun and celebratory. Calling to mind the elaborately decorated masks used in the dragon or lion dances often performed during Lunar New Year parades, Chew?¡¥s three-dimensional masks are a contemporary take on the long tradition of paper-cut folk-art crafts created during this auspicious time of year.</p>

2022-year-of-the-tiger-stamp-celebrates-lunar-new-year-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2022 Year of the Tiger Stamp Celebrates Lunar New Year Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãThe Lunar New Year celebration fits squarely within America?¡¥s great cultural traditions. It is a time to prepare for a fresh start while honoring the past. ... It is an occasion to welcome good luck and prosperity,?¡À said Ronald A. Stroman, a member of the USPS Board of Governors, who served as the stamp ceremony?¡¥s dedicating official.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">He was joined by Michelle Yun, vice president of global artistic programs and director of the Asia Society Museum, and Anne del Castillo, commissioner of the New York City Mayor?¡¥s Office of Media and Entertainment.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãLunar New Year is a time when Asians and Asian Americans honor their cultural heritage and traditions, and this stamp series celebrates their prominence and influence on U.S. history and culture,?¡À del Castillo said.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Year of the Tiger begins Feb. 1, 2022 and ends Jan. 21, 2023.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The tiger is the third of the 12 zodiac animal signs associated with the Chinese lunar calendar. Many ancient fables and legends explain the origin of the zodiac signs. The most common story tells of the animals racing across a river to determine their order in the cycle. The rat crossed by riding on the back of the ox, jumping ahead at the last minute to win the race. Next came the ox, then the tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster and dog, followed by the boar in last place.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">As with other zodiac signs, personality traits and other attributes are often associated with people born in the year of a particular animal.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Those born during the Year of the Tiger may be seen as brave, confident and well-liked by others. Blue, orange and gray are lucky colors for tigers, and yellow lilies and cineraria may also bring good luck. Other predictions about important milestones in life are often made based on a person?¡¥s zodiac animal sign, including romantic compatibility, career trajectory and health prospects.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lunar New Year is one of the most important holidays of the year for many Asian communities around the world, including in the United States, China, Vietnam, South Korea and Singapore. Across these varied cultures, many traditions exist for ringing in a new year of good luck and prosperity.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Known as Tet in Vietnam and the Spring Festival in China and elsewhere, Lunar New Year begins on the second new moon after the winter solstice and historically marks the arrival of spring. Filled with symbolic meaning, the colors red and gold appear everywhere during this auspicious time of year. Red is considered very lucky, while gold is supposed to bring wealth.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In the first few days of the new year, parades and pageants are common with dancers, acrobats and musicians. The festivities also mark a major occasion for folk artists making paper-cut crafts for celebration.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on the night of the first full moon after New Year?¡¥s Eve, known as the Lantern Festival in Chinese culture. In the United States and elsewhere, the festival is marked with grand parades and brilliant lanterns decorating public spaces.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In observance of this holiday, the U.S. Postal Service introduced its third series of Lunar New Year stamps in 2020. This new series will continue through 2031 with stamps for the Year of the Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Boar still to come.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Art director Antonio Alcal¡§¡é worked on the series of stamps with artist Camille Chew to create Lunar New Year imagery that is fresh, fun and celebratory. Calling to mind the elaborately decorated masks used in the dragon or lion dances often performed during Lunar New Year parades, Chew?¡¥s three-dimensional masks are a contemporary take on the long tradition of paper-cut folk art crafts created during this auspicious time of year.</p>

2019-cactus-flowers-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2019 Cactus Flowers Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In 2019, the USPS issued 10 new Forever stamps picturing different cacti in bloom.? The species shown were Engelmann's prickly pear, fire crown, Texas rainbow, dahlia, scarlet hedgehog, hatchet, golden Tom Thumb, eagle's claw, glory of Texas, and silver ball.? They are just a handful of the many cacti that produce beautiful flowers.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Generally, cacti are rather slow-growing plants.? They can be started from seed, but usually will not reach adult size for several years.? Even then, it takes even longer for the plant to reach maturity and begin to flower. ?One of the most well-known species, teh saguaro cactus, takes over 100 years to bloom. ?When a cactus does finally produce flowers, they last for only a day or two before dying off.? While at their peak, cactus flowers are some of the most stunning and delicate of any other bloom.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Since cactus flowers are so short-lived, pollinators in their habitats have to be quick to get to the delicious nectar inside. ?Each cactus species is specially adapted to suit a particular animal that pollinates them. ?Some are large and white so that bats can easily locate adnd feed from them. ?Others grow deeper, making them a favorite stop for hummingbirds ¡§C some of these flowers will hide this tiny pollinator's entire body while it feeds!? Thanks to these creatures, flowering cacti are able to keep producing fruit and seeds, which will make more plants and ensure their breathtaking flowers will be around for years to come.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",true,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,137-520-100,0.0,shopify,991,continue,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/c1335e9fa495fac3.webp?v=1728359770,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/c1335e9fa495fac3.webp?v=1728359770,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

2011-save-vanishing-species-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2011 Save Vanishing Species Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">On September 20, 2011, the USPS issued its fourth semi-postal stamp, to raise money wildlife conservation.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">As early as 2000, the World Wildlife Fund and Wildlife Conservation Society proposed the USPS create a semi-postal stamp to help raise money for wildlife conservation.? Their efforts paid off when Congress passed the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semi-postal Stamp Act of 2010.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Issued on September 20, 2011, the semi-postal stamp pictures an Amur tiger.? Also known as the Siberian tiger, the Amur once roamed Western and Central Asia.?Their organs and bones, used in Asian medicine, and their lush pelts made them a profitable target for poachers.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">During the 20th century, the Amur tiger vanished from several nations and its wild population became nearly extinct throughout the region.? Today, only a few hundred are known to roam freely.? The image of an Amur tiger cub was made by Nancy Stahl, the artist behind more than 20 US postage stamps.? She used photographs of the species as inspiration for the stamp.</p>
</div>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Save Vanishing Species semi-postal stamp sold for 11?¨¦ more than the first-class postage rate at the time.? The additional funds were given to the US Fish and Wildlife Service to support worldwide conservation efforts.? They, in turn, gave the funds to the Wildlife Without Borders program, which funds conservation efforts, both inside and outside the US.? The program issues grants to five different multinational groups involved in protecting elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, marine turtles, and great apes.? By joining conservation agencies from around the world, the United States is able to cross borders to reverse the threat of extinction to these animals.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">According to a WWF representative, ?¡ãThis is an easy way for individuals to use their purchasing power to help save vanishing species every time they mail a letter. By purchasing these stamps, anyone can play a direct role in protecting some of our most iconic and endangered wildlife.?¡À</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The original law made the stamp available from September 2011 until December 2013.? During that time, over 25 million stamps were sold, raising over $2.75 million dollars.? In 2014, President Obama signed a bill reauthorizing the Save Vanishing Species stamp to continue sales through 2018.? As of July 2018, the stamp has raised over $5.2 million.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">While many other butterfly species can be found across North America, the California dogface butterfly's range is limited to Central and Southern California. ?This led California to adopt the dogface butterfly as its official state insect in 1972.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Commonly located in wooded areas of the Santa Ana Mountains, the California dogface is picky about its habitat.? Adult butterflies feed mainly on nectar from purple flowers like thistles.? Eggs are laid only on false indigo plants, with caterpillars feeding on the vegetation until they pupate.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Male dogface butterflies' wings are yellow-orange with black sections on the upper pair (forewings) ¡§C a design that resembles a dog's face.? This earned the species its strange name. ?Females, on the other hand, are completely yellow with a single dark spot on each forewing.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The California dogface butterfly's unique wing pattern makes it a sought-after species by many nature photographers. ?However, the california dogface flies exceptionally fast, making it difficult to spot one with its wings open long enough to take a photo.?

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Writer and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats was born on March 11, 1916, in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Born to poor Polish-Jewish immigrants, Keats enjoyed art from an early age.? He was very creative, creating works of art from scraps of wood, cloth, and paper.?While Keats?¡¥ father attempted to discourage him from the difficult life of an artist, he also occasionally brought him home tubes of paint.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Keats spent a good amount of time at the local library learning about art.? He also found some comfort in his school art classes.? In junior high he received a medal for drawing that he kept for the rest of his life.? He went on to win a national contest in high school for an oil painting and was honored for excellence in art upon graduation.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Following his father?¡¥s death, Keats had to put art school on hold and worked a variety of jobs, though he was able to take occasional art classes.? He was fortunate to find some artistic jobs during this time, as a mural painter and comic book illustrator.? When World War II broke out, he was drafted into the Army and designed camouflage patterns for the US Army Air Force.?</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">After the war, Keats spent some time in Paris.? When he returned to New York, he worked as a commercial artist, with his illustrations appearing in?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Reader?¡¥s Digest, The New York Times Book Review, and Collier?¡¥s</em>.? Keats also produced the artwork for several popular book jackets and in the 1950s, he exhibited his work at the Associated American Artists Gallery.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Keats was first approached to illustrate a children?¡¥s book in 1954, for Elisabeth Hubbard Lansing?¡¥s?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Jubilant for Sure</em>.? He would go on to illustrate nearly 70 books for other authors.? In 1960, he made his first attempt at writing his own children?¡¥s book,?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">My Dog Is Lost</em>.? Two years later, Keats published?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Snowy Day</em>, his most famous work.? The story follows a young child named Peter who experiences the delight of a first snowfall in his neighborhood.? This children?¡¥s book was one of the first to have an African American as the main character.? Keats earned the Caldecott Medal in 1963 for?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Snowy Day</em>.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Keats would go on to write and illustrate 22 books of his own.? His books often featured children from different cultures in urban settings.? Keats also always presented his characters with real problems that young readers would understand, including becoming an older sibling, standing up for friends, and dealing with bullies.?</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Keats worked until his death on May 6, 1983.? The Ezra Jack Keats Foundation carries on his legacy by promoting children?¡¥s literacy and creativity and encouraging equality and diversity in children?¡¥s books</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Flurries, squalls, snowstorms, nor?¡¥easters, snow bursts... all can drop significant amounts of white fluffy precipitation from the sky, but none are blizzards by definition.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">To qualify as a blizzard, winds of at least 35 miles per hour must accompany snow falling for at least three straight hours with visibility decreased to under a quarter mile.??Anything less is just snowfall.??But with the right conditions even plain old snowfall can escalate into a full-blown blizzard.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Blizzards are feared not only for the dangerous conditions they create, but also for the aftermath of these brutal storms.??Downed power lines and outages often follow in the wake of a blizzard.??Bitter temperatures and limited heating solutions can cause frozen and burst pipes, leading to flooding and property damage.??Significant snowfall often accompanies these storms, causing roadways to become slippery, obstructed or even completely impassable.??Roofs may collapse under heavy snow and the stress of shoveling has been known to cause heart attacks.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Modern meteorology cannot decrease the severity of blizzards.??But, luckily, the ability to predict such storms can lessen the impact on those stuck in its path.?????????</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Each of the 2015 Snowflake stamps pictures a different type of snowflake in a different color.??They were designed by Antonio Alcal¡§¡é and Leslie Badani.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This Wonders of America stamp honors Great Basin as the country?¡¥s largest desert.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">On October 27, 1986, Great Basin National Park was established in Nevada.? The park protects ancient bristlecone pines, Wheeler Peak Glacier, and more.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Some of the earliest-known Paleo-Indians in the Great Basin arrived as early as 10,000 BC.? Archaeological evidence shows the area had regular inhabitants for several thousand years that included the Shoshone, Ute, Mono, and Northern Paiute.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Fremont Indians, who lived in the Great Basin from about 1000 to 1300 AD, left behind a legacy of rock art in Upper Pictograph Cave.?

2023-red-fox-first-class-postage-stamps-1,2023 Red Fox First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Sold in panes of 20 and in self-adhesive coils of 3,000 and 10,000, the Red Fox stamp is intended for use by bulk mailers for items such as circulars, newsletters and catalogs. It can also be used by customers who enjoy using a variety of stamps on their envelopes and packages.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This new stamp features a pencil-and-watercolor illustration of a red fox. The handsome face of this wild canid is from preexisting artwork by Dugald Stermer (1936¡§C2011). Stermer masterfully captured the fox?¡¥s softness, striking coloration and gaze toward the viewer. His calligraphic labels in the stamp?¡¥s white background, under the animal?¡¥s face and between its alert ears, provide the common and scientific names, respectively: ?¡ãRED FOX,?¡À in widely spaced capitals, and ?¡ãVulpes vulpes.?¡À In tan, centered below the artwork, the stamp reads ?¡ã40c USA,?¡À in a sans-serif typeface. Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamp.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The range of the red fox covers almost all of the United States, including Alaska. This wild canid is absent only from Hawaii and parts of the Southwest. Highly adaptable, foxes are found not only in woodlands and open country but also in suburbs and cities, where they have learned to scavenge for a wide variety of food. Fox species can be found over much of the Earth, and the red fox is the widest ranging. Although the red fox can also be colored gray or white, it is named for its most common rusty coloration. This pigmentation typically includes darker forelegs and white fur both on the animal?¡¥s underside and on the tip of its bushy tail. In chilly weather, the tail, or brush, serves as a comforter when the fox curls up to sleep. Foxes often rest during the day and hunt at night.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Red foxes are versatile omnivores. They favor rabbits and other rodents and also partake of birds, fish, insects and invertebrates, as well as nuts, roots, berries and more.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,202-520-100,0.0,shopify,998,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/122104-L1_7a431a9f-9a9c-459e-b13c-99db4a341a03.webp?v=1728359696,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/122104-L1_7a431a9f-9a9c-459e-b13c-99db4a341a03.webp?v=1728359696,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

2021-bonsai-trees-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2021 Bonsai Trees Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">With these five Bonsai (Forever) stamps, the U.S. Postal Service celebrates the beauty of bonsai. The word ?¡ãbonsai?¡À (China for ?¡ãplant in a pot?¡À) refers to the art of cultivating plants, usually trees, in trays, pots, or other containers. Favorite bonsai plants include evergreens, maples, and azaleas, but many other trees and shrubs are also suitable.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">One of the common styles of bonsai is shown on each of these five stamps. The first stamp depicts a Sierra juniper in a semi-cascade style, in which the tip projects over the pot rim but does not extend below the base. Second is a trident maple in informal upright style, in which the trunk bends slightly to the left or right. The third is a black pine in formal upright style, with the trunk straight and tapering evenly, with symmetrical branches from the base to the apex. Fourth is an azalea plant in multiple-trunk style, with several trunks emerging from one root system. The fifth and final stamp shows a banyan in cascade style, in which the trunk evokes a stream flowing down a mountainside, with the tip extending below the pot?¡¥s base.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The plants depicted are roughly 15 to 20 inches tall.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The bonsai collection at the National Arboretum began in 1976 when the Nippon Bonsai Association in Tokyo, Japan, presented the people of the United States with 53 plants as part of the U.S. bicentennial commemoration.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">A bonsai master begins with seeds, cuttings, a naturally stunted tree, or a very young tree. Over time, they prune the roots and branches, use wire to shape and train them, and sometimes scrape or peel bark to achieve desired effects. Finally, the plant is watered and repotted when necessary and can live a hundred years or more.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Art director and stamps designer Ethel Kessler worked with artist John D. Dawson on the Bonsai stamps.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Forever stamps will always be equal to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce price.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",true,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,210-520-100,0.0,shopify,995,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/Bonsai-Stamps-_-2012-USPS-Forever-Stamps-001.webp?v=1728359673,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/Bonsai-Stamps-_-2012-USPS-Forever-Stamps-001.webp?v=1728359673,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The American flag has long symbolized the strength and spirit of our nation. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation establishing June 14 as Flag Day, which Congress officially designated in August 1949. Today, the American flag remains a powerful symbol.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Reminiscent of the 50 flags encircling the Washington Monument, the three flags represented on the stamp are shown as if on poles arranged in a circular formation. The design was painted using gouache on gesso board. Using three separate photographs of the same flag taken seconds apart as reference, the images were combined into a single composition. The flags, shown from a low-angle perspective, billowing in the wind, evoke a sense of reverence and honor. Laura Stutzman was the stamp designer and illustrator. Ethel Kessler was the art director.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The American flag has many nicknames, including the Stars and Stripes, the Star-Spangled Banner, and Old Glory, and has seen many changes throughout the history of the United States. The current flag has 13 alternating red and white stripes, symbolizing the 13 colonies that declared independence from the United Kingdom and became the first states of the United States. Fifty white stars, one for each state in the union, lie in a field of blue.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",true,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,043-GQZ,0.0,shopify,992,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/us-flag-forever-stamps_1_cd1b45eb-6906-4c6c-af5e-1e15f19b0db2.webp?v=1728359663,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/us-flag-forever-stamps_1_cd1b45eb-6906-4c6c-af5e-1e15f19b0db2.webp?v=1728359663,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">This stamp commemorates 200th anniversary of Star-Spangled Banner.?The stamp?¡¥s image is from a photo of flag that flies over Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine.?It was taken during fireworks display at annual Defenders?¡¥ Day celebration.</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">?During the War of 1812, Mary Pickersgill was commissioned to sew a flag ?¡ãso large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance.?¡À?The flag was to fly over Baltimore?¡¥s Fort McHenry, which the British hoped to capture.?</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">Pickersgill was asked to make ?¡ãone American ensign, 30x42 feet, first quality bunting.?¡À?A smaller flag of lighter materials was also ordered for use during bad weather.?Over 400 yards of wool bunting was needed to construct the larger flag, which weighed about 50 pounds.?Because of its size, the work was done on the floor of a nearby brewery after the business had closed for the day.</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">The British began bombarding Fort McHenry on September 13, 1814. ?Francis Scott Key witnessed the 25-hour assault from a ship in Chesapeake Bay.?Because it was raining heavily, Key likely saw the smaller flag at ?¡ãtwilight?¡¥s last gleaming.?¡À?But as morning neared, the oversized flag was defiantly hoisted above Fort McHenry.?The sight inspired Key to write lyrics about the ?¡ãstar-spangled banner.?¡À</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">If not for fate, the Battle of Fort McHenry would have had a more explosive ending.?Only the fort?¡¥s commander knew that its gunpowder magazine, over which some 2,000 shells fell, was not bombproof.?A direct hit would have destroyed the fort instantly.</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">?</div>
<div data-mce-fragment=""1"">Gary Clark was the photographer for the stamp?¡¥s image.?He said it was difficult to get the fireworks and the flag at the same time because it was windy the night he took the photo at the Defenders?¡¥ Day celebration.</div>",Foreverstamp,,"","",true,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,046-GQZ,0.0,shopify,932,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/5221f5ee74135c97.webp?v=1728359620,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/5221f5ee74135c97.webp?v=1728359620,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Adding a vital African American voice to American literature, Ernest J. Gaines brought worldwide attention to generations of men and women who asserted their own dignity in the face of racial oppression and violence.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Gaines was born on Riverlake Plantation in the town of Oscar just outside New Roads, LA, where his family had lived in the former slave quarters for five generations. He moved to California in 1948, but for decades afterward, his fiction reflected a deep and unbreakable connection to the rural Louisiana of his youth.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">After serving in the Army for two years and graduating from college, Gaines received a prestigious fellowship in 1958 to study creative writing at Stanford University. He published his first novel, ?¡ãCatherine Carmier,?¡À in 1964, but he achieved true fame, widespread acclaim, and a Pulitzer Prize nomination in 1971 with ?¡ãThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,?¡À a novel chronicling the recollections of its 110-year-old African American protagonist, whose life spans slavery to the civil rights era.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In 1981, Gaines took a position teaching creative writing at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana) and soon became its writer-in-residence. In 1983, he published the novel ?¡ãA Gathering of Old Men,?¡À about a group of African American men who assert their humanity and pride in the face of long-standing prejudice and violence.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In 1993, Gaines published his most critically and popularly acclaimed novel, ?¡ãA Lesson Before Dying,?¡À about a college-educated African American teacher who provides education and inspiration to a young farmhand awaiting execution for murder. Over the course of their difficult visits in prison, they form a bond that shows both the need to resist those who would deny them their dignity and self-respect. In addition to earning the National Book Critics Circle Award, ?¡ãA Lesson Before Dying?¡À resulted in Gaines receiving a prestigious MacArthur Foundation ?¡ãgenius grant.?¡À</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Passed as a clause in the Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX is a civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. In the 50 years since its passage, Title IX has been applied widely at elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions. The law covers a broad range of programs and resources. Most visibly, Title IX has created pathways for enriching women?¡¥s athletics programs, allowing for more competitive sports offerings, stronger physical education regimens and equal spaces to play. Additionally, Title IX prohibits sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking on school campuses or during school programs or activities. Fifty years later, Title IX is still evolving. The law has affected generations of young people in the United States, and the work to provide protections for even more in the future continues.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,217-520-100,0.0,shopify,1000,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/481704-L0.webp?v=1728359594,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/481704-L0.webp?v=1728359594,oz,,,true,,,true,,,draft

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Each fall, millions of gardeners bury bulbs in the earth, eagerly anticipating the rewards that springtime will bring. Months later, thick green leaves poke through the soil, soon revealing their treasure: tulip blossoms in spectacular variety from prim to ostentatious.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">A member of the lily family (Liliaceae), the tulip (genus Tulipa) originated as a wildflower in Central Asia. Dutch immigrants brought the first tulip bulbs to America hundreds of years ago. Today, we import more than 1 billion bulbs per year.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Debuting in 1950, ?¡ãPeanuts?¡À garnered hundreds of millions of readers worldwide. Its original cast included Charlie Brown and Snoopy, soon joined by Lucy, Linus and others. Each character reflects Schulz?¡¥s rich imagination and great humanity. Charlie Brown, at the heart of ?¡ãPeanuts,?¡À is often defeated but always resilient. Schulz?¡¥s resonant stories found humor in life?¡¥s painful realities including rejection, insecurity and unrequited love.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In the 1960s, ?¡ãPeanuts?¡À became a worldwide phenomenon with beloved television specials, books, a Broadway show and countless products.

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In the dead of winter, when trees have shed their leaves and snow has blanketed the ground, the lively sights and sounds of resident birds can be a welcome relief.

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Birds in Winter stamps are being issued as Forever stamps in booklets of 20. These Forever stamps will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce price.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Now most modern suit jackets come with a buttonhole in the lapel and a small loop (about an inch down) sewn on the reverse side.?

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This new Forever stamp celebrates women?¡¥s soccer in the United States. From youth leagues to the elite world champion U.S. National Team, millions of girls and women throughout the country participate in the fast-paced, competitive sport.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Soccer, also known as football internationally, is the most popular sport in the world, played by hundreds of millions of players in almost every country. In the United States, women?¡¥s soccer has gained a firm foothold in sports and popular culture. From youth leagues to the elite world champion U.S. National Team, millions of girls and women across the country participate in the fast-paced, competitive sport.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The stamp artwork depicts a female soccer player in action, striking a ball with a side volley. Conjuring the aesthetic of mid-century print design, illustrator Noah MacMillan (1988-2022) used simplified shapes and bold colors to convey the high energy and fast motion of the sport. The somewhat grainy rendering lends a timeless quality to the design, evoking not just a single all-star athlete or era, but the entire legacy of women?¡¥s soccer.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,242-520-100,0.0,shopify,1000,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/483004-L0.webp?v=1728359424,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/483004-L0.webp?v=1728359424,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãSince the 1800?¡¥s, the Postal Service has used stamps to celebrate the legacy of great Americans and we are proud to do that today with this striking stamp of Chief Standing Bear,?¡À said?<a href=""https://about.usps.com/who/leadership/board-governors/anton-hajjar.htm"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-href=""https://about.usps.com/who/leadership/board-governors/anton-hajjar.htm""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Anton G. Hajjar</em></a><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">,</em>?vice chairman of the USPS Board of Governors. ?¡ãAlthough the United States was founded on the principle that ?¡ãall men are created equal,?¡À it took our country far too long to recognize the humanity in many of its people ¡§C including the American Indians who lived in these lands for thousands of years. I hope this stamp will serve as a reminder of the lessons we?¡¥ve learned from Chief Standing Bear, and the brave Ponca people, especially here in the Cornhusker State.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Chief Standing Bear (circa 1829¡§C1908) was a member of the Ponca tribe, who lived in the Niobrara River Valley in what is now northeastern Nebraska. The tribe's traditional homeland was included in the Great Sioux Reservation established by the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. The federal government later decided to resolve conflicts between the Sioux and the much smaller Ponca tribe by relocating the latter to the Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The U.S. Army?¡¥s forced removal of some 700 Ponca began in the spring of 1877. Some members of the tribe died during the 600-mile journey by foot. More than a hundred others, including Standing Bear?¡¥s only son, died from disease and hunger shortly after the removal to the Indian Territory. Wanting to honor his son?¡¥s dying request to be buried in the tribe?¡¥s Niobrara homeland, Chief Standing Bear and a small band of some 29 other like-minded Ponca made the arduous trip back to Nebraska in 1879. They were arrested by the Army and imprisoned at Fort Omaha.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">After attracting the sympathy of a newspaper reporter and the Army general who arrested him, Standing Bear sued the federal government for his freedom. Lawyers filed for a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf to test the legality of his detention, the first time in U.S. history such a filing had been made on behalf of a Native American.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In the closely-watched court case,?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Standing Bear</em>?v.?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Crook</em>, Judge Elmer Dundy ruled on May 12, 1879, that an Indian was a person under the common understanding of the word and that all persons in the United States, regardless of race, had an inherent right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The judge ordered that Standing Bear and his fellow Ponca be released from custody.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">""Chief Standing Bear is a pillar for the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska and one of the pivotal civil rights leaders in American history,?¡À said?<a href=""https://www.poncatribe-ne.org/council/tribal-chairwoman/"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-href=""https://www.poncatribe-ne.org/council/tribal-chairwoman/"" target=""_blank""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Candace Schmidt</em></a>, the chairwoman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. ??¡ãThe Ponca Tribe is elated that this stamp will help illustrate his story of justice and triumph, which is also our story. It also serves as a symbol of the pride and perseverance for all of our members past, present, and future.""</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">A subsequent congressional investigation concluded that the government had blundered and made a mistake when it gave away the Ponca homeland and later when it forced their removal to the Indian Territory. President Rutherford B. Hayes recommended to Congress that the Ponca be allowed the choice of where to live and that they be compensated for land and other losses. Congress passed legislation to that effect in March 1881.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">?¡ãIt?¡¥s remarkable, that the story of Nebraska Native American civil rights leader Chief Standing Bear has progressed from a native man being considered a non-person by the U.S. Government in 1879, to today, being recognized by the Postal Service with a stamp honoring him as an American icon,?¡À said?<a href=""https://indianaffairs.state.ne.us/staff/"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-href=""https://indianaffairs.state.ne.us/staff/"" target=""_blank""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Judi M. gaiashkibos</em></a>, executive director of the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs. ?¡ãThis story of an indigenous rights hero is truly and necessarily an American story. This stamp further etches his legacy in our national consciousness and provokes necessary conversations about race, sovereignty and equality in the United States.?¡À?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Standing Bear and the members of the Ponca who had followed him returned to their old Nebraska reservation along the Niobrara River, where the chief died in September 1908. In 1924, one issue that his 1879 trial had raised was finally resolved when Congress adopted the Indian Citizenship Act, which conferred citizenship on all Native Americans born in the United States.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,239-520-100,0.0,shopify,1000,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/483704-L0.webp?v=1728359407,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/483704-L0.webp?v=1728359407,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

2015-contemporary-christmas-a-charlie-brown-christmas-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2015  Contemporary Christmas: A Charlie Brown Christmas Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">On December 9, 1965,?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>?first aired on television.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>?creator Charles Schulz had his first cartoon series published at the age of 25.? Entitled?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Li?¡¥l Folks</em>, it featured a character named Charlie Brown. When the syndicate opted not to renew the strip, Schulz developed a new one, named?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>, which debuted on October 2, 1950 in seven newspapers.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Schulz?¡¥ comic strip?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>?had become a worldwide phenomenon by the mid-60s.? After the?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>?gang was pictured on the cover of?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Time Magazine</em>, Coca-Cola commissioned a Christmas special starring the characters.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>?was written and animated in just six months.? The script was simple, sparse, and heavily influenced by Schulz?¡¥ background.? Deeply religious, he wanted to focus on what he believed the ?¡ãtrue meaning of Christmas?¡À to be.? Schulz then added secular themes taken from his Minnesota childhood, including a school play, falling snow, and ice-skating.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Professional child actors were only used for the voices of Charlie Brown and Linus.? Schulz convinced the producers to use regular children for the remaining characters.? Studio employees took tape recorders home and had their children audition for the part.? Gibberish was recorded for Snoopy and sped up to make his unique sound.? Schulz also resisted the use of a laugh track, which was widely used during the ??60s.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Television producer Lee Mendelson was the driving force behind?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>.? Composer and conductor Vince Guaraldi provided jazzy original songs, resulting in a fresh, up-tempo holiday sound unlike any before it.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Mendelson was a 32-year-old documentary maker whose first work was about Willie Mays.? Seeing a?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>?comic strip about Charlie Brown?¡¥s baseball team, he decided he had ?¡ãdone the world?¡¥s greatest baseball player, now he should do the world?¡¥s worst?-?¡À Charles Schulz agreed, beginning a 30-year collaboration that resulted in over 40 animated?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>?specials.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">As he began production on?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>, Mendelson approached Guaraldi to arrange the soundtrack.? Guaraldi wrote ?¡ãLinus and Lucy?¡À and ?¡ãChristmas Time Is Here?¡À for the special.? A choir of children, some chosen because they were slightly off-key, was selected to record the songs.? Sessions ran late into the night and ended with rewards of ice cream.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The soundtrack, described as being filled with ?¡ãsmall, observant miracles,?¡À is a piano-based jazz score which was unheard of in programming for children.? Combining an upbeat tempo with the loveable?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Peanuts</em>?characters introduced jazz music to an entire generation. Its charm has made it the tenth best-selling holiday album in history.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Work on?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>?was completed just 10 days before its scheduled premiere. Executives previewing the special thought it was terrible, one claiming, ?¡ãMy golly, we?¡¥ve killed it.?¡À? But one animator deemed it ?¡ãthe best special?- this show is going to run for a hundred years.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas premiered on December 9, 1965, at 7:30 p.m. It was watched by some 45 percent of the viewing audience that night ¡§C?an estimated 15,490,000 homes. It was the number two show in the ratings that night, after?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Bonanza</em>. In spite of the executives fears, it was very well received by viewers and critics alike. It was described as ?¡ãdelightfully novel and amusing?¡À and ?¡ãfascinating and haunting.?¡À Another critic accurately predicted that ?¡ãthe Peanuts characters last night staked out a claim to a major television future.?¡À</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Fresh and innovative,?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>?featured a number of entertainment ?¡ãfirsts.?¡À? Together with its creator, the animated musical special also influenced the television industry, ushering in a host of changes.</p>
</div>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>?was the first to use children to voice animated characters.? It also established the half-hour animated special as a holiday tradition, inspiring other classics like?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">Frosty the Snowman</em>?and?<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em>.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><em data-mce-fragment=""1"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>?was also ground- breaking in its biblical references.? When executives tried to talk Schulz out of them, he replied, ?¡ãIf we don?¡¥t do it, who will??¡À? As it turned out, Linus?¡¥ recitation from the Gospel of Luke is considered one of the most powerful moments in the film.</p>

2013-contemporary-christmas-gingerbread-houses-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2013 Contemporary Christmas: Gingerbread Houses  Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The fondest holiday memories often include the scent of warm ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and molasses used in gingerbread drifting throughout the house. With a little imagination and a lot of patience, gingerbread can be converted into a whimsical house decorated with stiff royal icing and sparkling candies.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Gingerbread recipes originated during the Middle Ages, when maidens tempted knights with the spiced bread. By the early 1600s, American colonists were enjoying the richly flavored treat, although Christmas would not be widely celebrated for years to come.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Over time, bakers learned to cut or mold the dough into a variety of shapes, including animals and people. Heart-shaped gingerbread tied with ribbon was a popular treat at European fairs. The 1812 publication of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel, inspired German bakers to create witches?¡¥ houses out of gingerbread. By the time Christmas was declared a national holiday in 1870, gingerbread houses had already become a beloved winter tradition in America.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Building gingerbread houses today can be as simple as buying kits or as complex as constructing small buildings from scratch, giving people of all skill levels the chance to create joyous holiday memories.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Baker Teresa Layman created the gingerbread houses specifically for these stamps.??Sally Andersen-Bruce photographed them and art director Derry Noyes designed the stamps.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">A key figure in some of the most pivotal moments of the Civil Rights Movement, John Lewis was the face of the Nashville Student Movement, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, an original Freedom Rider, and one of the keynote speakers at the historic 1963 March on Washington. Even in the face of hatred and violence, Lewis remained resolute in his commitment to what he liked to call ?¡ãgood trouble.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Devoted to equality and justice for all Americans, Lewis spent more than 30 years in the U.S. House of Representatives steadfastly defending and building on key civil rights gains that he helped achieve in the 1960s. He was a staunch and unwavering believer in and advocate for nonviolent protests. The recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees, he was called a ?¡ãsaint?¡À by Time magazine and ?¡ãthe conscience of the Congress?¡À by his colleagues.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">He served as executive director of the Voter Education Project; as associate director of ACTION, the federal volunteer agency that oversaw the Peace Corps and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA); and as a member of the Atlanta City Council. He was also the author of several bestselling books, including the ?¡ãMarch?¡À comic book series and the inspiring autobiography ?¡ãWalking With the Wind.?¡À</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Elected to represent Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986, Lewis garnered the support needed to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1991, sponsored the legislation that created the 54-mile Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail, and worked for more than a decade to establish the National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, DC. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation?¡¥s highest civilian honor, by President Barack Obama.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 15 (75 Stamps),,,,,,,,256-520-100,0.0,shopify,997,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/483204-L0.webp?v=1728359347,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/483204-L0.webp?v=1728359347,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

2023-pinatas-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2023 Pi?atas Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Scholars believe pi?atas might have their origins in China, where medieval European explorers described a New Year?¡¥s custom that sounds familiar to us today. A brightly decorated animal figurine was beaten with a stick until it broke open, releasing the seeds contained in the hollow interior. After the remains of the vessel were burned, the ashes were gathered for good luck during the coming year.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">By the 14th century in Italy, a similar practice ?a possibly imported from China by Marco Polo ?a became part of festivities during the season of Lent. Rather than the brightly adorned figure that featured in the Chinese ceremonies, the Italians used an undecorated clay vessel called the pignatta (?¡ãfragile pot?¡À), which was filled with sweets rather than seeds. As the custom migrated to Spain, breaking the pignatta ?a pi?ata in Spanish ?a evolved into a form of celebration on the first Sunday in Lent. The pi?ata came to the New World with Christian missionaries in the 16th century.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">At the time of the Spanish arrival in what is now Mexico, the Indigenous people had their own traditions. The Aztecs, for example, decorated clay pots with feathers and filled them with small gifts. After hanging clay pots in front of statues of their gods, they struck the pots with sticks until the vessels broke and the treasures inside fell to the ground as offerings.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Spanish missionaries combined these ceremonies with their own Lenten tradition to attract Christian converts. Used as religious instruction, the pi?ata represented the devil and temptation. The blindfolded ?¡ãplayer?¡À symbolized blind faith armed with the stick of goodness; breaking open the pi?ata showed the triumph of good over evil.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Today, the pi?ata is still an important part of many celebrations in Mexico and the United States, and the custom has spread to other countries. Pi?atas feature in all manner of festivities: holidays, birthdays, anniversaries and weddings. They are a traditional part of the posadas, a nine-day festival held in early December that commemorates Mary and Joseph?¡¥s journey to Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Historically, the pi?ata-maker ?a called the pi?atero or pi?atera ?a began with a clay pot as the base, which was covered with shredded paper and engrudo (a paste made from water and flour or cornstarch).</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The design emerged as the maker attached cones and other forms to the prepared pot. Gluing strips of curled and cut tissue paper over the entire structure, the artist turned the clay vessel into a swan or a bull or a seven-point star ?a almost anything imaginable. Today, a traditionally crafted pi?ata might begin with a frame made of reeds tied with string; a homemade pi?ata sometimes uses a balloon as the base. Whether mass-produced, handcrafted by artisans or made at home, pi?atas are easily found to fit any occasion or taste.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The customs surrounding pi?atas today are very similar to those from centuries ago. Filled with treats and presents, the pi?ata hangs by ropes that can be manipulated to move up, down or sideways. A blindfolded player tries to strike the pi?ata with a stick while the rope is pulled to make a direct hit more difficult. Each player takes a turn until one breaks the pi?ata, scattering its contents on the ground to be gathered up by all the participants. Though the meaning of breaking the pi?ata has evolved, the result is still the same: bounty for all.</p>",Foreverstamp,,"","",false,Quantity,5 Sheets of 20 (100 Stamps),,,,,,,,263-520-100,0.0,shopify,1000,deny,manual,29.99,,true,false,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/684404-Z0.webp?v=1728359332,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0904/0606/0310/files/684404-Z0.webp?v=1728359332,oz,,,true,,,true,,,active

2014-imperforate-winter-flowers-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2014 Imperforate Winter Flowers Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Across much of the United States, the coming of winter merely signals the blooming of garden varieties that prefer cooler outdoor weather. But in many regions across the north and in higher elevations, winter means snow-covered flower beds and long, dark days inside. Blissfully, nature has given gardeners in those areas a host of stunning flowering plants that are adaptable to the indoors.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Amaryllis, cyclamen, and paperwhites are grown from bulbs, much like their cousin, the daffodil. Perennial amaryllis plants put forth flowers in a range of colors and patterns as well as single, double, miniature, trumpet, and extra-large blossoms. The blooms?¡¥ beauty lies in their appearance alone, as they have no fragrance.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Cyclamen are sensitive to over-watering and temperature. If their native Mediterranean climate is duplicated, cyclamen will bloom profusely for several months. Paperwhites are easy and versatile, flourish best when grown in water alone, and adapt to a variety of interesting containers. The Christmas cactus is native to South America and can live for decades, being handed down through generations.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Because winter flowers chase the chill and gloom away, they make ideal holiday gifts, fun family projects, and a special treat for nearly everyone.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Stamp artist William Low photographed potted plants at the peak of their blooming as the models for these stamps. He then created digital paintings of the flowers.?</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Each year, the story of Jesus?¡¥ birth and early life is retold during the Christmas season. The Magi, or Wise Men, had traveled a great distance to find the ?¡ãKing of the Jews.?¡À They honored the child, born in a lowly stable, with expensive gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. But Herod, the ruler of Israel, worried about losing his throne to a potential rival, so he plotted to destroy Jesus.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Joseph, Jesus?¡¥ earthly father, was warned of Herod?¡¥s plot in a dream and was instructed to take his family to Egypt, beyond the reach of the brutal king. The young family began the 200-mile journey immediately, not daring to wait until sunrise. The precious gifts from the Magi provided for the family?¡¥s needs during their flight into Egypt.?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Bible gives few specifics about the family?¡¥s trip, but traditional stories provide details. While they were traveling, Mary became hungry. Jesus commanded a palm tree to bend down so his mother could reach the dates growing on the tree. Another legend tells of idols, objects of worship, falling to the ground and breaking when Jesus passed by.</p>

2023-osiris-rex-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2023 OSIRIS-REx Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This new 20-stamp pane from the U.S. Postal Service celebrates NASA?¡¥s seven-year OSIRIS-REx mission to study and map the asteroid Bennu and return a sample of the surface to Earth in September 2023. This is the first pristine sample of an asteroid collected by the United States, and it will help scientists learn how our solar system formed.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The stamp artwork shows the capsule containing the sample parachuting to the Utah Test and Training Range, a U.S. Department of Defense facility in the desert. A depiction of Bennu?¡¥s surface appears at the bottom of the pane?¡¥s selvage with outer space above ?a deep blue and dappled with celestial bodies. A view of the asteroid is in the upper right corner.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">OSIRIS-REx left Earth aboard a rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, FL, on Sept. 8, 2016, then orbited the sun for a year before passing close to Earth for a gravity assist. The spacecraft arrived in the asteroid?¡¥s vicinity in December 2018 and got to work. With its special cameras and spectrometers, it began photographing and mapping Bennu?¡¥s surface to determine the best site from which to collect samples.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The time for the rendezvous arrived in October 2020. To carry out its task, the spacecraft did not actually land on the asteroid but instead slowly descended toward the surface and extended a robotic arm. A collection device at the hand-end of the arm then released a sudden puff of nitrogen gas that sent up a cloud of dust and rocks from Bennu?¡¥s surface. More than 2 ounces of these materials were captured in a special container in the collection device, which then closed and retracted into the spacecraft. On May 10, 2021, OSIRIS-REx began its flight back toward Earth. Its container of asteroid dust and rocks, enclosed in a special capsule, will parachute to the Utah desert on Sept. 24, 2023.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Alan Dingman illustrated the stamp and pane, basing his work on images supplied by NASA. Antonio Alcal¡§¡é, an art director for USPS, designed the stamp and pane.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Five centuries ago, Francesco d?¡¥Ubertino Verdi (1494¡§C1557), the Italian Renaissance painter known as Bachiacca, was a versatile and popular Florentine artist. Today his oil-and-gold-on-panel painting Madonna and Child still evokes the timeless traditions of Christmas.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Bachiacca met the needs of his patrons by skillfully adapting to changing fashions, whether creating large altarpieces, small paintings, wall and ceiling decorations, or designs for intricate tapestries. His compositions emphasize ornament and landscape backgrounds, and art historians note his eye for exotic costuming and his careful depictions of animals and plants.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Around 1540, Bachiacca became a court painter to the duke of Florence, Cosimo de?¡¥ Medici, who had made the Palazzo Vecchio his residence and required an artist for a wide range of interior decoration. For nearly the rest of his life, Bachiacca created ceiling decorations for the duke and duchess, as well as mural and easel paintings, tapestries, costumes and masks.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Dated from the early 1520s, the Madonna and Childstamp shows Christ clutching a bouquet of jasmine, a symbol of divine love.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This painting is part of the Jack and Belle Linsky Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. William J. Gicker served as art director and Greg Breeding was the designer.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Description:</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Since his debut in the short-subject cartoon ?¡ãA Wild Hare?¡À in 1940, generations of audiences have cheered Bugs?¡¥ gleeful gusto, quick wit and endless clever resourcefulness. To outwit the opposition, he can conjure dynamite, cherry pies and mallets out of thin air; dance like a seasoned hoofer; play piano; and conduct orchestras. He summons up any talent ?a and any costume ?a that will help him thwart his relentless foes.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Born of a team of young animators who produced Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons for Warner Bros., Bugs?¡¥ name came from one of those early cartoonists; ?¡ãBugs?¡À and ?¡ãBugsy?¡À were trendy nicknames at the time, signifying a crazed or wacky disposition. The catchy alliterative sound of ?¡ãBugs Bunny?¡À partnered well with the names of cohorts Porky Pig and Daffy Duck.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">More importantly, each gift also holds spiritual meaning:?Gold represents Jesus?¡¥ divinity and kingship on Earth, frankincense symbolizes his holiness, and myrrh refers to his eventual suffering and death.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The new $10 Floral Geometry stamp complements similar $2 and $5 stamps issued in 2022. These stamps lend a contemporary appearance to packages, large envelopes and other mailings.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Floral Geometry stamps began as an exploration of the patterns found in nature, specifically the symmetry of flowers.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The designs feature a series of overlapping geometric shapes ?a circles, ovals and triangles ?a that reflect the symmetry of floral patterns. As the stamp denominations rise from $2 to $5 to $10, the designs become more complex.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The watercolor backgrounds were painted by hand and scanned. The background for the $10 stamp is red; white geometric lines and typography were added digitally. A foil treatment adds a stylish glimmer.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The stamps were designed and created by the firm Spaeth Hill.

2024-u-s-flags-forever-first-class-postage-stamps,2024 U.S. Flags Forever First Class Postage Stamps,"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The Postal Service continues its tradition of celebrating the U.S. flag with these stamps in booklets of 20, and coils of 100, 3,000, and 10,000.</p>
<p>Four stamps show the U.S. flag majestically waving at different times of the day. While the shapes and colors of the clouds change, the sun is always shining on the flag. The flags, shown from a low-angle perspective, draw attention upward, toward the magic of the sky. The illustrator painted the designs using gouache on illustration board.</p>
<p>Stars and Stripes on the U.S. flag's design date to June 14, 1777, when the Continental Congress specified 13 horizontal stripes and 13 stars to honor the original colonies. The 13 stripes have appeared on every version of the flag except from 1795¨C1818, when there were 15 stripes for the 15 states in the Union. The Flag Act of 1818 standardized the number of stripes as 13 and stipulated that a star would be added for each new state. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation establishing June 14 as Flag Day, which was officially designated by Congress in 1949.</p>
<p>Since the first flag, there have been 27 versions as more states have entered the Union. The current flag was created when Hawai¡®i was added as the 50th state in 1959, with the 50-star flag debuting on July 4, 1960. The current design is the longest used in the country¡¯s history.</p>
